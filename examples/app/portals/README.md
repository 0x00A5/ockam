## What is a Portal and how you can use it

A TCP Portal makes a remote TCP service appear on localhost, virtually adjacent to TCP clients.

All communication happens over end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated Ockam Secure Channels. Channels are established over multi-hop, multi-protocol transport routes that can include bridges, relays, or rendezvous. This enables end-to-end encrypted portals that can traverse NATs, firewalls, and clouds without any change to networks or infrastructure.

TCP Portals are different from VPNs because there is no virtual IP network, there is only a single virtualized point-to-point TCP connection over an end-to-end encrypted channel. TCP Portals are also different from reverse proxies and load balancers because there is no exposed entrypoint to the Internet. The two ends of an Ockam Portal can live in completely private networks that don't expose any listening ports or allow any ingress. Unlike TLS termination at loadbalancers, end-to-end Ockam Secure Channels do not expose your application's data to a third party operator. Data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality are guaranteed between the two ends.

Under the covers Ockam Secure Channels use lightweight and robust cryptographic primitives that have been proven, at scale, within modern systems like Signal, Whatsapp, and Wiregaurd. The design of our open source stack of [protocols](#the-protocols-that-enable-remote-tcp-service-to-appear-on-localhost-next-to-a-client) and their use for TCP Portals was recently audited by the security research firm Trail of Bits. The executive summary of their report states: _"None of the identified issues pose an immediate risk to the confidentiality and integrity of data handled by the system in the context of the two in-scope use cases (TCP Portals and Kafka Portals). The majority of identified issues relate to information that should be added to the design documentation."_ We're very excited about the report and in the coming weeks, we'll share this report and a detailed writeup about the audit process.

You can create production ready portals using Ockam Command to privately connect applications across companies, VPCs, regions, clouds, and data centers. Our team is fully remote and we wanted an easy GUI to privately share services with our teammates and friends. Everyone on our team uses a Mac so we created an open source macOS menubar app using SwiftUI and the Ockam Rust library.

Each TCP Portal has two parts:
1. A TCP Outlet runs adjacent to a TCP server. The outlet decrypts and unwraps all Ockam Routing information and delivers raw TCP messages to the server. It also encrypts and wraps messages destined for clients with Ockam Routing information which allows these messages to be delivered to the corresponding Inlets.
2. A TCP Inlet that runs adjacent to one or more TCP clients. The inlet encrypts and wraps any messages destined for the server in Ockam Routing information which allows these messages to be delivered to the corresponding Outlets. The inlet also decrypts and unwraps all Ockam Routing information and delivers raw TCP messages to the clients.

If the outlet is within a private network, the outlet and inlet nodes only make outgoing TCP connections and the outlet is made reachable to inlets using an encrypted relay or a NAT puncturing rendezvous. An inlet and an outlet are mutually authenticated using unique cryptographic identities and credentials. Each connection is also authorized using granular attribute-based access control policies.

### Portals.app

First, let's install the app. If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then you can install with this simple command:

```
brew update && brew install --cask build-trust/ockam/portals
```

If you prefer to install the app manually, download and install it using the appropriate dmg file for your Mac. If you have an Apple Silicon based Mac, install from [this dmg file](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/releases/download/ockam_v0.113.0/ockam.app.aarch64-apple-darwin.dmg). If you have an Intel based Mac, install from [this dmg file](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/releases/download/ockam_v0.113.0/ockam.app.x86_64-apple-darwin.dmg).

Next, let's see the Portals.app in action in this quick 2 minute video (please unmute for an explanation of what is happening):

## How we built a Swift macOS app that uses our Rust library

The functionality, of the app, was already implemented in Ockam rust crates. So our focus was building a great native macOS experience.

Our first attempt at building the app was using Tauri. This made sense as we wanted to use the Ockam rust library and most people on our team are comfortable building things in Rust. This first version was easy to build and had all the basic functions we wanted. However, the experience of using the app wasn't great. Tauri only gave us minimal control over how the menu was rendered and what happened when a user interacts with the menu. This version of the app felt like it belonged in a 10 year old version of macOS when compared to super easy to use menubar items built into macOS Sonoma.

We realized that to have the rich experience we want we must build the app using SwiftUI.

Unfortunately, we couldn't find a an off-the-shelf solution to integrate Swift and Rust that would give us the best of both worlds - the safety of using rust and rich macOS-native experience of SwiftUI. Digging in a some more, the command ground is - Rust is compatible with the C calling convention and Swift is interoperable with Objective-C which is a superset of C-89 - so we can connect the two worlds using C-89.

Here's what that looks like:

<img width="1012" src="https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/assets/159583/b5e691bd-fd96-41f0-922a-d32d7bf12f34">

We wrote the Rust data structures that needed to be visible to Swift twice. One version is idiomatic in Rust and easy to use. The other version is C compatible using pointers and memory that is manually allocated with `malloc`. We also exposed some C-compatible APIs that use raw-pointers in unsafe rust to converted the idiomatic data structures to their C-compatible versions. Finally we automatically generated a C header with the help of the `cbindgen` library.

On the Swift side, we could've called the C APIs directly but C data structures are not first class citizens in Swift which makes them harder to use idiomatically within SwiftUI code. We instead chose to duplicate the data structures in Swift and convert between C and Swift. This may seem like a maintenance burden, but practically the state shared between the two worlds doesn't change that often while the ability to quickly build components in SwiftUI using constructs like `if let ..`, `ForEach`, `enum` etc. is super helpful.

Here's an example of the same structure in its 4 forms:

```
// Rust idiomatic structure
#[derive(Default, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct LocalService {
    pub name: String,
    pub address: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub shared_with: Vec<Invitee>,
    pub available: bool,
}

// Rust C-compatible structure
#[repr(C)]
pub struct LocalService {
    pub(super) name: *const c_char,
    pub(super) address: *const c_char,
    pub(super) port: u16,
    pub(super) shared_with: *const *const Invitee,
    pub(super) available: u8,
}

// Generated C header structure
typedef struct C_LocalService {
  const char *name;
  const char *address;
  uint16_t port;
  const struct C_Invitee *const *shared_with;
  uint8_t available;
} C_LocalService;

// Swift idiomatic structure
class LocalService {
    let name: String
    @Published var address: String?
    @Published var port: UInt16
    @Published var sharedWith: [Invitee]
    @Published var available: Bool
}
```

The Swift app is statically linked to our Rust lib at compile time. Data flow is simple. UI interactions are sent from Swift to Rust as actions by calling C APIs. Change events are emitted only by Rust, Swift is notified using callbacks that lead to updates to the user interface.

Most code in the SwiftUI views looks just like any other SwiftUI application.

```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
    Text(service.sourceName).lineLimit(1)

    HStack(spacing: 0) {
        Image(systemName: "circle.fill")
            .font(.system(size: 7))
            .foregroundColor( service.enabled ? (service.available ? .green : .red) : .orange)

        if !service.enabled {
            Text(verbatim: "Not connected")
        } else {
            if service.available {
                Text(verbatim: service.address.unsafelyUnwrapped + ":" + String(service.port))
            } else {
                Text(verbatim: "Connecting")
            }
        }
    }
...
```
